# Optimizing-App-Offers-with-Starbucks-

This project analyzes Starbuck customers’ behaviors to learn how people make their purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers. Customer profile, promotions and customer purchasing events datasets are available for this analysis. 

There are three goals for this project:
1.	Identify a cohort whose purchasing decision is not affected by the promotional offers
2.	Build a classification model to identity cohort who will be most likely to purchase with promotional offers
3.	Identify an efficient way to send promotional offer to customer
